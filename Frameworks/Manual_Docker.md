# Docker Manual

Released in 2013, Docker represents a huge shift in the IT ecosystem introducing `containerization`. Basically a containers reduce the complexity software development lifecycle serving in a single platform the tools required for deploying, testing even when the application is developed in different languages, frameworks, or on different clouds and so on. The maintenance of software is another crucial factor that has led docker to be a must. There is no need to rewrite code, it is just a different way of running and packaging an application and moving around an infrastructure.

## Docker Editions

Docker has two main edition: `CE` the free community edition and `EE` the paid enterprise edition. Since it is a technology that moves super fast, it is important to have always the latest version installed. Docker is native on Linux, therefore the direct installation can happen there. The version for Windows and Mac are run Docker on top of a VM since it is not directly supported by the OS. Another possibility is given by the cloud installation, on AWS for example, where Docker is preinstalled (usually on Linux) and has a number of special features ad hoc for cloud usage.
