    "First lets define what overloading is:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Overloading` in object oriented programming is the ability to create more then a function with the same name al long as its signature is different (essentially if the two functions are distinguishable, i.e. different number/type of arguments etc..). When the program is compiled, the interpreter will understand, based on the signature at which function with the same name we are referring to. \n",
    "\n",
    "In python, since there is no static typing, we can't declare a function signature, therefore, overloading, in its strict sense, is not possible. A workaround to this problem is called  `single dispatch generic function`, which allows us to overload functions based on the type of the first argument (if we want to consider the type of more arguments we need `multi dispatch`).\n"
