consol# Javascript Manual

Javascript is an high-level, object-oriented, multi-paradigm programming language. In web development, while htm and css are responsible for the content and the styling of the webpage, js is responsible for handling its dynamic and user interaction, to load data, e.g. from databases, to manipulate html and css content and so on. Frameworks like React, Angular and Vue.js are tools that enhance the creation of webpages and are 100% based on js. In the same way we can use js also outside the browser, on webserver, to build back-end services with framework like node.js.

## JS release
Starting from 2015, with the release of ES6 (ECMAScript) we talk about modern javascript, and since then an annual release has been done with some new features.

## Run JS code
JS code needs always to be related to an html file. We can directly code inside the html file under the `<script>` tag. We can watch what we have executed using the webpage inspector under the `console` tag only if we have redirected the output to the console itself using the command `console.log(my_var)`. However, what is done in practice is to create a separate `script.js` file that will contain the js instruction and will be loaded inside the html file. The connection between html and js is usually done at the bottom of the body part as:

```js
<script src="script.js"><script>
```

## Styling rules
* commands must be ended with semicolon `;`
* variables are written in camelCase style
* variables cannot start with numbers, and can contains only number, letters, dollar sign and underscore
* variables cannot use reserved keyword like *new* or *function*
* variables shouldn't start with upper case letter (uppercase are related to class)
* constant are written in uppercase
* use descriptive variable even if a bit longer

### Comments
Simple comments are done with the `//` while multi-line comments are done with `/* ... */`

## Values and Variable
Values are basically the smallest unit of information that we have in js; these can be stored in variable with the assignation symbol `=`. To declare a variable we simply:

```js
let firstName = "Giovanni";
```

*firstname* is now a variable that stores a string and can be later be manipulated or printed to console. `let` has to be used only the first time we declare a variable, if we want to reassign a value to an existing variable we don't need it. 

N.B. we can declare more than one variable at the time and also leave it without assignment (e.g. `let x, y;`)

### Variable declaration
We have seen that to declare a variable the first time we use the keyword `let`, while to mutate its content we can simply call the variable name. There are other methods from ES6 to declare variables that are more expressive: 

* `const` is used to declare variable that cannot mutate; for this reason, it is not possible to declare empty const variable.

* `var` is the prior ES6 declaration, `not to be used anymore!`

As a best practice, it is better to always use `const` to declare a variable unless we are really sure it should be changed along the script. We want to have the minimum amount of mutable variable in the code since these can be source of bug.

We can potentially use a variable without using any of these constructors and it will work just fine, but it is a terrible idea since it want have a reference in the local scope of the script!

## Datatype

Like python, js is a dynamically typed programming language, meaning that the type of data passed to a variable is not declared but directly inferred by js and, in general, can be changed at any time. It is the value that as ah inherent type, not the variable.

We can inspect the type of a value or a variable by using the operator `typeof` 

```js
console.log(typeof true);
// output: boolean
```

There are several type of datatype in js. but first of all lets distinguish between `object` and `primitive`.

`Primitive` are:
* numbers, by default floats
* string
* boolean
* Undefined, a variable that has been declared but not assigned
* Null, another empty value (n.b. for legacy reasons, *typeof null* will return *object*)
* Symbol, a value that is unique and cannot be changed
* BigInt (from ES2020), a larger integer, too large for the number type

## Basic Operator

Basic operations are performed in a similar manner in every high level programming language at least similar to python for what I know). For a complete list of `operator precedence` see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence; most operation are carried out left-to-right but some others, like assignment or exponential are applied right to left, meaning that the lest part of the expression is first evaluated and the assigned to the right part (same in python)Â·

### Mathematical

* `+` is summation and string concatenation
* `-` is subtraction
* `*` is multiplication
* `**` is power elevation

### Assignment

Operator that assign or reassign values to variables

* `=` assign a variable to a value e.g. `x = 10`
* `+= or -= or *= or /=` in line operation on the variable
* `++ or --` increase/decrease the variable by 1

### Comparison

Comparison operator works as expected, producing a boolean value in output.

* `>, <, >=, <=` are the comparison operator

## Strings 

Strings are very important primitives types. They can be concatenated with the `+` sign, and js will automatically convert the type to a string if possible, or in a cleaner way (from ES6) with `strings template` (basically python f-string).

```js
const name = 'Giovanni';
const stringTemplate = `My name is ${name}!`; // `` back ticks required
```

In the same way, the back ticks format of writing strings is very useful to write multi-line strings simply returning each new line.

```js
const multiLineString = `This is a
                        multi-line
                        string`
```


## if, else control structure

The `if / else` code block si defined as `control structure` and is composed by:

```
if (condition) {
        executed if true
    } else {
        executed if false
    }
```

Everything that is defined inside the control structure exist only there, therefore, we cannot use a variable that is defined/created inside the if/else block outside of the block itself. We have first to define the variable outside the structure to be able to access it again after it has been modified by the if/else.

```js
const name = 'Giovanni';
const age = 19;

if (age >= 18) {
    console.log(`${name} can drive a car!`);
} else {
    const yearsLeft = 18 - age;
    console.log(`${name} isn't old enough to drive!
He will be in ${yearsLeft} years`);
}
```
